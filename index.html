        <p> Howdy! My name is Louis Salamone. I'm born and raised in Ohio in a small river-side town that has a very 
            small population, and eventually left home at 18 to attend Ohio University as an Audio Engineer and Music
            Indusrty major.
            <br>
            <br>
            My time in ohio and especially at OU were fantastic - but upon graduating it was time for a new chapter 
            - and i landed a job at a recording studio in Denver, CO, which is kind of all an ideal situation as i had a few 
            friends out yonder and am super involved in the outdoors.
            <br>
            <br>
            My audio involvemtn is primarily music recording as well as mixing and mastering - being lucky enough to work on projects all around the country with some amazing engineers. I feel very lucky for the life i have!
